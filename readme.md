# Advent of Code 2022

This is my first attempt at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and I wanted to document it. From the Advent of Code About page:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
